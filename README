This project provides a library to talk to QHYCCD cameras from Linux.

More information about QHYCCD cameras can be found on http://www.qhyccd.com

QHYCCD also works on an SDK to more easily access their cameras. In the
current state, however, this SDK still has many deficiencies which make it
unsuitable for my AstroPhotography project. This project is intended as
a stopgap measure to provide a robust driver library so that a QHY driver
can be written for the AstroPhotography project. Accordingly, it does not
have as wide a scope as the QHYCCD SDK.

To develop this driver library, the SDK was used as a kind of documentation
of the interface to the QHYCCD cameras. There apparently does not exist any
documentation whatsoever, so one really has to read the SDK source code to 
learn about the cameras. Currently the SDK only supports a limited range of
cameras, and I myself only have a QHY8PRO camera, so I currently cannot extend
this project to support other cameras. If you have a different camera, you
are welcome to subclass CameraOld/CameraNew into a camera specific class and
provide the methods needed to support a new camera (read qhy8pro,{h,cpp} for
more information).
